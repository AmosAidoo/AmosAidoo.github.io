My name is Amos Aidoo. The purpose of this blog is to write about things that I am learning about and things that interest me. I have typically done that in notebooks which I probably end up throwing away after a while. I believe by doing so here, it would be easier for me to come back to them anytime for reference as well as be helpful in some ways to others.

I acknowledge there could be mistakes in what I write here.
